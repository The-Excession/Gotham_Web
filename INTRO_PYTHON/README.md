# Intro Python Tools

**Developers**: Lianys Feliciano, Daniel Gallego.

This module provides helpful tools for getting more comfortable with many of it's popular packages, as well as diving into some specific tools and tricks that will be useful for learning to utilize the rest of the tools in this repository. The list of tutorials available are: 

1. Intro_to_Python: introductory Python tutorials with available exercises. Shows how to navigate a Jupyter Notebook, the different opreators in Python, arrays and other data structures, and conditional statements. 

2. Intro_Plotting: tutorial on useful tools for visualizing data using packages such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. 

3. Importing_Data: short tutorial on how to navigate this repository through running command lines in a Jupyter Notebook. For the most part, whenever data from a different sub-pacakge is required the relevant tutorial will already have this command as one of the first cells to run (so that the user doesn't have to find it themselves). However, in the case one wants to access sample data or methods from a class outside of the sub-package they are working in, or if they simply want to understand what these cells in the tutorials are doing, this tutorial should help.
