# Gotham Web Tools

**Developers**: Lianys Feliciano, Daniel Gallego, Janvi Madhani, under the supervision of Dr. Charlotte Welker. 

This repo centralizes and generalizes a number of modules used across the GothamWeb group to analyze hydro simulations, characterize the cosmic web in cosmological 
simulations and/or spectroscopic galaxy datasets and perform statistical analysis on large datasets. It also includes introductory tutorials aimed at Python and HPC beginners.

The repo is organized into a number of sub-directories that aim to provide the tools and a hopefully thorough explanation of how to use those tools for users from all backgrounds, including beginners. Each sub-directory (which is the same as saying each "sub-folder") is, for the most part, comprised of the following: 

- a **package** (usually titled the same as the parent directory but in lower-case font) that contains all of the relevant functions and/or modules (in the form of .py files). Looking into these files will give more details of how the functions of this package work. Modules and modular programming allow code to be used independently and interchangeably (think more "self reliant") through the use of classes and the functions that belong to each class (called methods).
- a set of **tutorial** Jupyter notebooks. These tutorials are meant to help visualize what some of the tools in each package can do in an easy-to-read format and in what context these tools might be helpful (though of course, they can and should be used in different contexts - which is a benefit of modular programming). In some tutorials, a step-by-step "guide" shows how more complex methods might make their calculations. In others, the driving science behind the package might be the focus. In all cases, the tutorials are meant to be easily run but informative.
