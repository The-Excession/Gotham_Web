This repo centralizes and generalizes a number of modules used across the GothamWeb group to analyze hydro simulations, characterize the cosmic web in cosmological 
simulations and/or spectroscopic galaxy datasets and perform statistical analysis on large datasets. It also includes introductory tutorials aimed at Python and HPC beginners.
Routines were developed by Lianys Feliciano, Daniel Gallego and Janvi Madhani under the supervision of Dr. Welker.
