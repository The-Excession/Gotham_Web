## STATISTICS TOOLS

This module provides useful tools for performing statistical analysis of data. This routine was developed by Daniel Gallego. The list of available tutorials and descriptions are below: 

1. Summary_Statistics: short lesson on some of the different kinds of summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc) as they are available through the Numpy package. 

2. Resampling_Methods: tools for performing bootstrap and jackknife resampling, as well as short explanations on these resampling methods. 

3. Residuals_and_Decoupling: tools and short tutorial for finding the residuals of two parameters (ie. decouple a parameter X from Y). In the tutorial sample GAMA data is utilized by decoupling galaxy mass from age. 

In the package itself, the *stat_functions* file is seperated into three categories (by way of ### comment) into Outlier Treatment, Residual Functions and Resampling Functions.
